# askthe6god
Android app built with Indico API at the Hack the 6ix Hackathon.

# Premise
Have you ever wanted to talk to the almighty 6ix god? We all know he is watching but have you ever spoke to him directly? Well, look no further than the ask 6god Android application, blessing you with the opportunity to ask 6god for advice, answers or general life advise.

# How It's Made
Leveraging the Indico.io API calls in Java we were able to create meta information for many Drake lyrics. By retrieving and storing information provided by Indico, such as the sentiment (happiness factor of the lyric), the top 3 key words from the lyric, and 5 predefined text tags, we were able to create a context for individual lyrics to be used as responses. Within the application the user is able to pose a question, and through Indico api calls, we create this same data for this question and using parse and a super top secret selection algorithm, we output best matching lyric as the response. i.e: You: Why does it only snow when it's cold outside 6ix god: Because they rocking furs like its snowing in the south.
